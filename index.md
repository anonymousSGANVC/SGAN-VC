Non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion transfers the speech of the source speaker into an arbitrary style of the target speaker without parallel data, while keeping the source speech content unchanged. Especially when the target speaker does not exist in the training set, it is a challenge to accurately extract style information. Therefore, the task demands the model to have excellent robustness and generalization.

We propose a new voice conversion framework, i.e., Subband-based Generative Adversarial Network for Voice Conversion (SGAN-VC), explicitly exploits the style spatial characteristics of different subbands to convert each subband content of source speech separately.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/anonymousSGANVC/SGAN-VC.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
